# Vertex AI Widgets

This repository aims to provide a suite of javascript bookmarklets that can be used to deploy a Vertex AI widget into the current webpage, if security policies allow.

The injection is done purely by manipulating the HTML in the browser. No remote services are affected by using this bookmarklet.

##Â Available Bookmarklets

- [Dialogflow Messenger](./public/js/dialogflowmessenger.js)

1. In the browser, right click on the bookmark bar
1. Select the "Add page" option

1. In the URL, paste the contents of the widget file

## Help! It's not working!

This is most likely because the website doesn't allow external content to be loaded, meaning this menthod will not work. The bookmarklet should present you with a warning if this is the case. You can verify by checking the JavaScript console for an error. (ctrl/cmd + I, then select "Console"). Unfortunately, you will need to use another method.

## Remove Widget

Simply reload the page.
